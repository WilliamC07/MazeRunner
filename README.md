# MazeRunner
AP Computer Science Spring Term Final Project 2019

# William  
5/17/19:  
Created bash script to compile and run the project and added the jar.  
Wrote boilerplate code for Wall, Character, and Main  
Can render Wall and Character  
5/18/19:  
Can determine point of intersection between two line segments  
More boilerplate code (distance formula, accessors)
Merged ray casting to master  
5/19/19:
Draw additional rays to give a smoother field of vision
Fixed calculating intersection between two line segments and intersection between a ray and line segment  
5/20/19:
Half completed ray casting drawing triangles for field of vision. A small bug of not drawing some triangles
Merged and connect Eric's work to mine  
5/21/19
Floating point rounding error bug found
Class time to figure out a better way to represent the maze in memory to increase efficiency
5/22/19
Fixed ray casting -- actually works now (tested on custom walls)
Cleaned up Ray.java to simplified creation (only one constructor; down from 3)
Merged ray_casting_fix to master  
5/23/19  
Found out ray casting is still broken  
Continued work on ray casting
5/24/19
Continued work on ray casting  
5/25/19
Finished ray casting and removed testing code
Merged ray casting fix to master  
Working on converting a boolean[][] of where walls are to a 2D grid of walls
5/28/19  
Continued working on wall Generation  
Merged working branch to deal with merge conflict early  
5/29/19  
Fixed generating horizontal walls (fixed infinite loop)  
Starting working on vertical walls  
5/30/19

5/19/19  
Initial Attempts at Basic Maze Generation  
5/20/19
